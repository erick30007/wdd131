        <h2>Best Places to Eat</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Una Pizza Napoletana</h3>
            <p>Did the first baker in Naples to smear tomato pulp on a patch of dough realize he was starting a cult? He was, and its house of worship in New York is Una Pizza Napoletana. True believers can recite the standing menu of six pies. Some pies bring the pinprick acidity in buffalo mozzarella to the foreground; others hit you with oregano’s mildly druggy aroma of camphor. But above all, the faithful come for the soft, tender, char-freckled crust.</p>

            <h3>Tacos El Borrego</h3>
            <p>Nobody ever seems to use its name. You just say you are going to the late-night al pastor cart on Roosevelt Avenue and people in this part of Queens know what you mean, even though Tacos El Borrego is far from the only one. It also sells a lot more than al pastor. Taqueros whose movements are a blur fill tender, soft corn tortillas with all the usual meats, supplemented sometimes by brains and eyes and tongue, to make palm-size tacos that sell for $2.50 each. Is a low price for a great taco.</p>

            <h3>Shopsins General Store</h3>
            <p>did you hear about the Shopsins General store, its says that He tried to ban critics, fearing they might attract new customers who wouldn’t understand such unhinged diner food as mac-and-cheese pancakes and Blisters on My Sisters. You may not quite get them, either, but go anyway. To eat at Shopsin’s is to see once again the beauty in going your own way, critics be damned. if you like mini stores this is your place to have a nice meal.</p>
