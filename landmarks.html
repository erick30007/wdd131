            <h3>Angkor Wat: Siem Reap, Cambodia</h3>
            <p>The ancient temples spread across Angkor Archaeological Park constitute one of Southeast Asia's most significant archaeological sites. This UNESCO World Heritage Site showcases the remains of the capital of the Khmer Empire from the ninth to 15th centuries, including the world's largest religious monument: the expansive Angkor Wat temple complex. As you explore the rest of Angkor, the Bayon temple at Angkor Thom, which sits north of the main complex, is also not to be missed. If you want to manage your own visit, it's easily accessible by taxi, tuktuk or even bicycle from the city of Siem Reap, as the park is on the edge of the city.</p>
